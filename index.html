                      I started my career as an engineer, working  on physical construction projects, managing large scale complex infrastructure, and analyzing thousands of engineering designs for quality and cost efficiency.

                      My journey into tech began with coding simple games and apps, and evolved into a passion for computer science, data science, user experience design, and software as a service. After immersing myself in a Data Science master's degree program, I learned the principles of data structures, algorithms, data processing, the economics of software engineering, and the value of data visualization and digital marketing.

                      One of my biggest accomplishments is founding my first startup MusicMind. I was able to design the product, create a database, hire a team of engineers, and raise $40,000. I am currently consulting for cryptonapp.com, a cryptocurrency investing product to be released in 2018.

                      I am currently a data science student mentor for thinkful.com. In addition to using all types of modeling, forecasting, and prediction, I also have a lot experience with machine learning, and, most recently, I used Tensorflow to create computer vision models to classify the life stages of produce.

                      I Also have a ton of hacking experience developing scripts, software, UI, security, devOps, database access management, collecting and mining data from public APIs, as well as parsing html, xml, and unicode text.
